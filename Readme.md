# How to notify about changing an updated record and allow overriding the changes without a refresh
<!-- run online -->
**[[Run Online]](https://codecentral.devexpress.com/e5029/)**
<!-- run online end -->


<p>The example demonstrates a solution for the following task.</p><br />
<p>We have two (or more) users who are editing the same data row in GridView. While the first user is typing new values, the second user has committed his changes. When the first user commits his changes, a notification popup dialog will be shown. A user can override the second user's changes without refreshing the grid.</p><br />
<p>Please note that this example does not demonstrate how to check data in a database. It is assumed that it is known that data has been changed.</p>
